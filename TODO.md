# TODO

## Movegen
- Use a custom markdown file for UAI
  - Once complete, change the links in the docstrings and review that
- Clean up a bit of the file organization -> move some data types into their own files
- Implement tests
- Cut out all the CLI code and put that into a separate project, importing the rest
  as an Azul-movegen crate
- Figure out if I want to use separate repos for each crate or if I want to keep them separate
  but within the same repo
